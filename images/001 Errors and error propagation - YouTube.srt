1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,059
hello class today we will be talking

1
00:00:02,158 --> 00:00:09,178
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> error propagation now error and</font>

1
00:00:06,059 --> 00:00:11,820
uncertainty are pretty much synonymous

1
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:14,669
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we will be using them interchangeably</font>

1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:17,250
but before we talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about error</font>

1
00:00:14,669 --> 00:00:22,948
propagation let's go back and review

1
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:25,800
what error / uncertainty is if you

1
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:29,240
remember we took the example of the red

1
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,109
ribbon measurement in a few slides ago

1
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:33,659
actually in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> case it's going to be a</font>

1
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:35,399
few<font color="#E5E5E5"> days ago I hope you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> remember that we</font>

1
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:38,279
say that the we demonstrated that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:40,140
error<font color="#E5E5E5"> is always on the last digit the</font>

1
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,120
uncertainty story is on<font color="#E5E5E5"> always</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font>

1
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:46,259
last digit because that digit is

1
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:51,078
estimated and we said all<font color="#E5E5E5"> these numbers</font>

1
00:00:46,259 --> 00:00:55,198
to 65 to 60<font color="#E5E5E5"> 62 67 or for that matter any</font>

1
00:00:51,079 --> 00:01:00,960
non-zero digit on the third<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1
00:00:55,198 --> 00:01:04,289
second decimal is valid<font color="#CCCCCC"> so 64 65 66 67</font>

1
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:10,019
68 all of those are<font color="#E5E5E5"> good and that</font>

1
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:12,450
includes also 61 and 69 so we could have

1
00:01:10,019 --> 00:01:14,250
written the we could write the length of

1
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:19,079
the red ribbon as two point sixty six

1
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:21,688
plus or minus 0.01 centimeters this

1
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:24,209
could be symbolized as a which

1
00:01:21,688 --> 00:01:27,379
represents two point sixty six plus or

1
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:30,868
minus Delta a and Delta a represents

1
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:33,060
0.01 centimeters and notice the<font color="#CCCCCC"> units</font>

1
00:01:30,868 --> 00:01:35,118
they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> very important in this case and</font>

1
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:39,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">we will talk about that in a few seconds</font>

1
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:41,129
now 0.01 centimeters is called or

1
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:44,849
centimeter is called absolute

1
00:01:41,129 --> 00:01:48,868
uncertainty it has units always keep

1
00:01:44,849 --> 00:01:54,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">that in mind now what would you call</font>

1
00:01:48,868 --> 00:01:56,269
0.01 over<font color="#CCCCCC"> two point 66 yes you right we</font>

1
00:01:54,750 --> 00:02:00,170
would call that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the relative uncertainty</font>

1
00:01:56,269 --> 00:02:02,849
and if you symbolize our Delta a over a

1
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:05,310
now the relative uncertainty could be

1
00:02:02,849 --> 00:02:07,408
written many different ways it could be

1
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:10,709
written as a fraction such as in this

1
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:12,780
case which is 0.01 over<font color="#E5E5E5"> two point 66 it</font>

1
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:13,890
could also be written as a percentage

1
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:17,520
for example if

1
00:02:13,889 --> 00:02:22,318
we had zero point if we had five over

1
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:26,129
100 that would be 0.05 or we could call

1
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:31,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">it five percent likewise if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we had let's</font>

1
00:02:26,129 --> 00:02:34,650
say 20 over a thousand that would be two

1
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:36,540
percent okay so rotary uncertainty could

1
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:40,680
be written as a fraction as a percentage

1
00:02:36,539 --> 00:02:43,979
it could<font color="#E5E5E5"> even be written as a plus Delta</font>

1
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,420
a now<font color="#E5E5E5"> notice that there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are no units in</font>

1
00:02:43,979 --> 00:02:49,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">this case that's the big difference</font>

1
00:02:45,419 --> 00:02:54,299
between our rotary uncertainty and

1
00:02:49,139 --> 00:02:56,759
absolute uncertainty okay now root of

1
00:02:54,300 --> 00:03:02,400
uncertainty is also a measurement of

1
00:02:56,759 --> 00:03:06,870
precision we<font color="#E5E5E5"> already mentioned that the</font>

1
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:09,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">only difference between uncertainty and</font>

1
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:12,480
error as far as we are concerned<font color="#E5E5E5"> again</font>

1
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:14,879
is that uncertainty is range and error

1
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:17,629
is a number<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember for error we could</font>

1
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:20,729
maybe we<font color="#E5E5E5"> could calculate it by using</font>

1
00:03:17,629 --> 00:03:23,609
experimental value of minus<font color="#E5E5E5"> accepted</font>

1
00:03:20,729 --> 00:03:25,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">value so that will give us one number so</font>

1
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:27,930
that will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> the error however</font>

1
00:03:25,259 --> 00:03:30,780
uncertainty as we have been seeing is

1
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:33,209
written as plus or minus a number dot a

1
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:34,349
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be a range okay so instead</font>

1
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:36,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">of just being one number is going to be</font>

1
00:03:34,349 --> 00:03:37,560
arranged<font color="#E5E5E5"> but as we are as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> far as we're</font>

1
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,900
concerned again<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm repeating myself</font>

1
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:44,400
here you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we can use those those two</font>

1
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:48,480
those two words interchangeably so back

1
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:51,329
to error propagation there are two rules

1
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:54,090
that you need to know one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them is</font>

1
00:03:51,329 --> 00:03:56,849
about multiplication and division and

1
00:03:54,090 --> 00:04:01,250
the second rule is about addition and

1
00:03:56,849 --> 00:04:04,349
subtraction so rule one is about

1
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:06,329
addition and subtraction when two

1
00:04:04,349 --> 00:04:10,879
numbers need to be added<font color="#E5E5E5"> or subtracted</font>

1
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:15,030
from each other then they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are then the</font>

1
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:19,100
the uncertainty of each must be

1
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:22,228
expressed in absolute form and then the

1
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:24,210
absolute uncertainty on the sum or the

1
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:26,038
difference he is going to be equal to

1
00:04:24,209 --> 00:04:27,129
the sum of the absolute uncertainties of

1
00:04:26,038 --> 00:04:30,009
the two numbers

1
00:04:27,129 --> 00:04:33,069
let me repeat<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if you have to</font>

1
00:04:30,009 --> 00:04:37,000
determine the absolute uncertainty of a

1
00:04:33,069 --> 00:04:39,759
sum or a subtraction first you have to

1
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,980
express the the uncertainties<font color="#CCCCCC"> of each</font>

1
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:44,560
numbers in their absolute form and then

1
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:45,850
you add them up<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay now you add them up</font>

1
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,519
whether you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> subtracting or adding</font>

1
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:52,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay used at the yacht the uncertainties</font>

1
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:54,609
are and this is important no it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:56,860
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> very simple algebra Delta a</font>

1
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:58,720
equals Delta a over a times a so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:00,790
the A's cancel out so you're lucky the

1
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,280
Delta this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is important because it will</font>

1
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:06,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">help us determine the reabsorption</font>

1
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:08,349
certainties when we have the relative

1
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:12,009
uncertainties just by multiplying by a

1
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:14,250
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is again the number rule number</font>

1
00:05:12,009 --> 00:05:18,339
two is about multiplication or division

1
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:21,009
so in this case if we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to determine</font>

1
00:05:18,339 --> 00:05:24,099
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> vertical if you need to determine</font>

1
00:05:21,009 --> 00:05:26,500
the uncertainty first we have express

1
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:30,010
the uncertainties on the numbers in

1
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:32,589
their relative form and then we add the

1
00:05:30,009 --> 00:05:35,500
two we add the two relative

1
00:05:32,589 --> 00:05:38,949
uncertainties<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right let's take</font>

1
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:41,850
examples to clarify all this example<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

1
00:05:38,949 --> 00:05:45,639
let's say<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have four centimeters plus</font>

1
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:48,760
plus or minus 0.1 we need to add this<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:51,819
12 centimeters plus or minus 0.2 so this

1
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:54,129
is an addition remember and this is an

1
00:05:51,819 --> 00:05:55,870
addition and the uncertainty is here

1
00:05:54,129 --> 00:06:00,399
what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> they are they relative or are</font>

1
00:05:55,870 --> 00:06:02,550
they are they<font color="#CCCCCC"> absolute they are relative</font>

1
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:06,729
right because there are no units on them

1
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:09,189
so what we so now what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need to do is</font>

1
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:11,470
convert them to absolute uncertainties

1
00:06:09,189 --> 00:06:13,060
because for addition and subtraction

1
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:14,830
remember we have to express the numbers

1
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:17,649
in their absolute uncertainties and then

1
00:06:14,829 --> 00:06:19,060
add them up so how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we get an absolute</font>

1
00:06:17,649 --> 00:06:21,429
uncertainty from a relative uncertainty

1
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:28,629
remember we have to multiply that by by

1
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:31,629
their number by a so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> do that 0.10</font>

1
00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:33,790
which is the relative uncertainty on the

1
00:06:31,629 --> 00:06:35,529
four centimeters we multiply that by<font color="#CCCCCC"> 4</font>

1
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:37,720
centimeters and we get zero point four

1
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:40,089
centimeters and then we do<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same for</font>

1
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,420
the uncertainty on the 12 centimeters so

1
00:06:40,089 --> 00:06:43,000
that would

1
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:46,530
0.2 times the number itself which is 12

1
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:50,560
and we get to point for now we have the

1
00:06:46,529 --> 00:06:59,519
absolute uncertainties so what we do is

1
00:06:50,560 --> 00:07:02,050
we go<font color="#E5E5E5"> ahead</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and add them up so 0.4 plus</font>

1
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:05,560
2.4 left will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> two point two point</font>

1
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:07,240
eight centimeters<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay now we add the</font>

1
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:11,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">two numbers also obviously because we</font>

1
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:13,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">are adding them so 4 plus 12 is 16</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

1
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:21,910
the final<font color="#CCCCCC"> answer is going to be 16 plus</font>

1
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:25,509
or minus 2.8 centimeters<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so</font>

1
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:28,360
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> still here so this is it we could</font>

1
00:07:25,509 --> 00:07:30,189
also go back if you want it to convert

1
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:32,230
it back to the relative uncertainties we

1
00:07:30,189 --> 00:07:34,930
could go to point a which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:37,930
absolute uncertainty / 16 to get the

1
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:40,329
relative uncertainty and there you go

1
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:45,490
and notice that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the units are not shown</font>

1
00:07:40,329 --> 00:07:47,589
here on zero point 18<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so we</font>

1
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:49,269
could also<font color="#CCCCCC"> write it as percentage so</font>

1
00:07:47,589 --> 00:07:51,219
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it for example</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 let's see the</font>

1
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:53,129
example 2 now in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> case we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

1
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:57,700
multiplying two numbers again

1
00:07:53,129 --> 00:08:00,550
four-point-oh by 12 and we have an

1
00:07:57,699 --> 00:08:02,229
absolute uncertainty of 0.1<font color="#CCCCCC"> 0 on the</font>

1
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:06,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">four and another episode uncertainty on</font>

1
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:08,650
the 12 which is 0.20 first we have to

1
00:08:06,029 --> 00:08:10,449
these uncertainties of course are

1
00:08:08,649 --> 00:08:12,429
absolute because we have units on them

1
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:14,319
so we need to convert them to rotate

1
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:16,030
relative uncertainties and then we add

1
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,620
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> electric uncertainties so you more</font>

1
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:21,189
polite the phone numbers and then the

1
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:23,170
root of uncertainties are added so we go

1
00:08:21,189 --> 00:08:28,149
ahead and figure out the irritable

1
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:31,150
certainties and then we go ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> and add</font>

1
00:08:28,149 --> 00:08:34,709
them so we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> multiply the two numbers</font>

1
00:08:31,149 --> 00:08:39,669
so 4 times 12 is 48 and we had the

1
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:43,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">favorite of uncertainties and here we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

1
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:46,389
oops here we go<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so this video</font>

1
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:48,490
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> already pretty much done nine minutes</font>

1
00:08:46,389 --> 00:08:51,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">long and I don't want the videos to be</font>

1
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:53,320
to go beyond 10 minutes<font color="#CCCCCC"> so feel free to</font>

1
00:08:51,789 --> 00:08:56,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">pause rewind</font>

1
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:58,350

1
00:08:56,679 --> 00:09:02,399

1
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:02,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">thank you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bye</font>
